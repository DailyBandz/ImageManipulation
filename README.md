Title: The Last Envoy

// Theme: Takeshi Kovac

// Inspiration: Takeshi Kovac is the main character in a show called Altered carbon. This piece of work is molded around, that is why the image is chosen as the main background
// The enovy image is chosen and inverted in particularly because the image shows the contrast of who Takeshi Kovac believes he is within the smoke not his outer skin
// The dragon is represented as a symbol of his true clan, enovys, this is why it is slightly transparent because its always in his subconscious of who he is.
// The unicorn is a statement piece which is only noticed by the keen watcher, he holds this unicorn bag through the show whilst being a solider throughout, it shows vulnerability. 
Hence why I've made it run across the image.
